# VAIO

A personal-use suite of tools for freelance 3D artist work: a FastAPI
backend + a hand-built HTML/CSS/JS frontend (no Node/React build step -
plain static files, so nothing extra to install). Light theme (dark
mode returns later as a toggle), set in Google Sans Flex.

All the navigation lives in one permanent 247px rail down the left -
there is no header. The rail holds the asterisk icon + "vaio" wordmark,
the app's single search box beneath it, then seven rows: Overview,
Projects and Studio Logs, a hairline, then To Do, Notes, Calculator
and Documents. Every row carries a Lucide icon plus its label and no
background of its own at rest; the open page's row gets a plain white
card with a soft shadow. Two rows sit apart at the rail's foot - the
theme toggle and Settings - reusing the same geometry but never taking
the active treatment, because they are switches and a dialog rather
than destinations. The rail never shrinks, collapses, or hides.
The content field takes everything else, square on every side with no
radius and no gap - only its left edge, against the rail, keeps a border
- and bleeds to the window's top, right and bottom edges. Overview is the home page and
the default on launch, reached through the sidebar like any other page.

- **Overview** (shown as such, internally still "Overview") - the
  app's home page, its "Full Board" layout (one of three combinations
  mocked up and compared side by side before shipping). A greeting
  ("Good morning/afternoon/evening", time-of-day driven) and today's
  date, top-aligned with the sidebar's "Workspace" label; a quick-capture
  field right below it drops a line straight into Notes on Enter, no
  need to leave the page. Below that, two paired rows - Today's Focus
  (up to 5 incomplete to-dos, newest first, check one off right there
  without navigating) beside Due Soon (up to 5 to-do tasks that are
  overdue, due today, or due within `DUE_SOON_DAYS` - the same window
  the toast uses, soonest first, an urgency-colored dot), then Active
  Projects beside Recent Notes - both capped at 3, tighter above than
  the row above them since there's less in them - and a small visual
  strip of the 4 most recently *created* notes at the bottom (each one
  its own color, same contrast logic Notes' own cards use). Every row's
  title renders in the Regular weight (Light reads too faint at this
  size) and is clickable, opening that item's real detail view via the
  same functions the header search already uses - nothing here is a
  dead end. The search box in the
  header searches titles across Tracker projects, Gatherer studios, To
  Do tasks, and Notes as you type, in a dropdown under the bar; clicking
  a result jumps to that tool and, where a detail view exists, opens it
  directly (a studio result just lands on Studio Logs, which has no
  per-row detail view).
- **Tracker** (shown as "Projects") - the panel wrapping the grid
  (and the Personal Projects panel below it) uses the darker `#e6e5e1`
  tone with no outline, so the lighter cards/fields inside stand out
  against it - the same panel/card relationship To Do's boards already
  use, just applied here too. A grid of project cards
  (auto-fits its cards to a 300px minimum width, so it may show two,
  three, or more across depending on window size), styled as an accent
  stripe rather than status pills: a colored left edge (amber Active,
  green Completed), a title, a two-line description clip, then Client
  and a Logs count (the number of Log rows under that project) at
  top-right. A hairline divider separates that from the footer -
  Status and Paid as plain colored/muted text with a dot between them
  on the left, the project's running Log Sum total (in its own
  currency) on the right. No date on the card itself. Status/Paid are
  no longer directly editable from the card (that pill-and-select look
  was dropped on purpose) - both live in the modal now, alongside
  everything else. An All/Active/Completed toggle above the grid
  filters which cards show; each view caps at 2 *rows* of cards, not a
  fixed card count - the grid wraps a different number of cards per row
  depending on window width (`repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr))`),
  so the cap is measured from where cards actually land after each
  render/resize rather than sliced off the list at a hardcoded index. A
  "Show more/less" button at the bottom reveals the rest so a long list
  doesn't dwarf the page. A "+ New project" button below the grid
  creates one. A
  small drag handle sits at the top-right of a card (next to the
  Client/Logs meta) on hover, for reordering - the order persists.
  Clicking a card anywhere else opens a popup: a description, project
  status, Paid, a client name, a deadline, a day rate (with a
  USD/EUR/GBP/BRL currency picker), "Docs" - a single place to attach
  both contract and invoice files (real file uploads, stored on disk
  next to the database) - and a side panel with Assets/Notes/Briefing
  tabs, each a freeform autosaving text area. Below that, a "Log" table
  for logging work sessions (Task, Status, Duration, Observation, Cost,
  Date), inline-editable like a spreadsheet - Duration auto-fills Cost
  from the day rate (Full = full rate, Half = half, Custom = manual,
  and unlocks the Observation cell) - with a running cost Sum in the
  selected currency; the card behind the modal keeps its own Logs/SUM
  stat live as tasks are added, removed, or re-costed, not just after
  the modal closes. Every field autosaves on blur/change, no separate
  save button. Below the grid, a collapsible **Personal Projects**
  section holds a second, simpler project list for work that isn't for
  a client - keeps the original row/table look (not cards; softened
  row striping - a faint tint plus a hairline under each row, not the
  harsh alternating grey the main table's cards moved away from), plus
  the same All/Active/Completed toggle, 5-row cap, and drag-to-reorder,
  but no Paid column. Its (wider) popup only has a
  description, project status, an Assets/Notes/References panel (no
  Client/Deadline/Day rate/Docs/Log, since none of that applies to a
  personal project), and a Checklist - a plain to-do list, checkbox on
  the left of a freeform title (checked items turn blue and get a
  strikethrough), with "+ Add item" for more rows. Backed by its own
  `personal_projects`/`personal_checklist_items` tables, entirely
  separate from `projects`.
- **Gatherer** (shown as "Studio Logs") - the table's wrapping panel
  uses the same darker `#e6e5e1`/no-outline treatment as Project
  Manager, so its lighter inline-editable fields stand out against it. A
  manually-curated list of studios/companies you find yourself
  (Behance, Instagram, wherever) - Title, clickable URL, Type
  (Studio/Company, a neutral grey pill - the type doesn't carry a
  status, so it doesn't get a status color), and outreach Status
  (Sent/Not sent, shown as a gray/green pill, with a date). Inline-
  editable like a spreadsheet: click a cell, type, it saves - no
  separate save button. Click "+ Add row" for a new one. The Type and
  Status column headers double as filters - pick a value to narrow the
  table to just that value, blank to show everything again.
- **To Do** - a Kanban board, one column per list, laid out side by side
  (horizontally scrolling once there are more than fit on screen) so
  every list is visible at once instead of clicked through one at a
  time. Column width stays fixed regardless of content - task titles
  wrap instead of stretching the column. A column's header holds a
  small color dot (the shared `.color-dot-btn` trigger - it grows on
  hover and opens the color preset popover; the chosen color also shows
  as a stripe on every card in that list), an editable title, a task
  count, and a delete (only visible on hover). "+ Add task" sits at the
  bottom of each column; a trailing "+ New list" column adds another
  list. Each task is a compact card: a colored stripe across the top in
  its list's color, the title, a checkbox to complete it without
  opening it, a Steps sub-checklist progress badge when the task has
  any steps (e.g. "2/5 steps", turning green once complete), and - when
  set - a due date shown as a small urgency-colored dot plus a relative
  label ("Today", "Tomorrow", "in 3 days") - red for overdue/today,
  amber for this week, blue for later, the same convention Command
  Center's Due Soon row uses. Checking a task off doesn't move it -
  it stays in place, title struck through and greyed, checkbox filled
  green. Favoriting lists exists at the data layer but isn't currently
  exposed in the UI. Clicking a card (anywhere but its checkbox) opens
  a detail view: title, a Due date field, a Steps checklist (a mini
  to-do list within the task, same checkbox-and-title pattern as
  Personal Projects' Checklist), and a freeform Notes text area.
  Everything autosaves on blur/change. Loosely inspired by Trello's
  card language (colored stripe + a checklist badge) but rebuilt in the
  app's own palette/type, not Trello's chrome. A **Due Soon** toast
  (bottom-right corner) checks for tasks that are overdue, due today,
  or due within `DUE_SOON_DAYS` (3) whenever the app loads
  and every 30 minutes while the tab stays open - in-app only, no
  email/Slack/background job - listing them with the same urgency-dot
  convention; dismissing it holds for the rest of the session, and
  clicking a listed task jumps straight to it.
- **Notes** - a Google Keep-style board of cards, titleless - a note is
  just a body of text, or a checklist, with no separate title field
  anywhere. A dashed "+" tile is always the first card; clicking it
  creates a blank text note and drops straight into its detail modal,
  Notepad-style, no picker in the way. The modal itself is flush -
  borderless, background-less textarea, just a thin divider and the
  delete control - with a toggle button that switches the *same* note
  between Text and List at any time (not just at creation): text-to-list
  splits the body on newlines into checklist items, list-to-text joins
  the items back into lines. The modal's extra top padding (46px, up
  from the 28px every other modal uses) exists purely to clear that
  toggle button and the close (x) button - both float via
  `position:absolute` at the same `top:10px`, and without the extra
  padding the first checklist row started underneath them instead of
  below. Cards themselves are read-only previews - clicking one
  (anywhere but its color/delete controls or a list item's checkbox)
  reopens that modal for full editing; a list note's items use the same
  checkbox-and-text row as To Do's Steps (a `<textarea rows="1">` that
  grows downward as its own text wraps, rather than a single-line input
  that would scroll long text out of view - `autoGrowChecklistText()` in
  nav.js drives it, shared by Notes/To Do/Personal Projects' checklist
  alike since they're the same row markup), with "+ Add item" for more,
  and can also be checked off straight from the card preview without
  opening the modal. Since there's no title, both the card
  preview and any place Notes show up elsewhere (Overview's rows
  and strip, search results) derive a short label from the body's first
  line, or a list's first item text. Cards flow into a responsive
  masonry grid (CSS columns, so it reflows its own column count as the
  window resizes) and can be dragged by a small handle to reorder - the
  order persists. Each card has the shared `.color-dot-btn` color dot,
  deliberately fed a fixed neutral rather than the note's own color -
  here the color already fills the card behind it, so a matching dot
  would disappear into its own background (the dot flips between a
  light and dark neutral so it stays legible either way). It opens the
  same shared color preset popover To Do's list colors use, applied as
  the card's full
  background - text on the card switches to dark automatically for a
  light enough pick - and an always-visible red delete button (with the
  themed confirm dialog).
- **Calculator** - shown under its own **Finances** sidebar group rather
  than inside "Personal". The active table's panel uses the same darker
  `#e6e5e1`/no-outline treatment as Projects and Studio Logs; the
  tab bar above the panel is unaffected, since it isn't part of the
  panel itself. Browser-tab-style, holding any number of independent
  ledgers ("tables"). A tab bar lists every table as a plain button
  showing its title - clicking one switches to it, and that's all a tab
  does; there's nothing to type into or delete on the tab itself.
  Renaming happens once, in an editable title field inside the active
  table's panel, next to a small currency pill (USD/EUR/GBP/BRL) - the
  tab it belongs to just displays whatever the title field currently
  holds. That title field, and a row's own Title below it, are both
  read-only until double-clicked (no outline in either state). A row's
  Title has its own pill to read as a field; the table title has
  nothing at rest - a panel under a heading reads as chrome - and
  advertises itself on hover instead, with the app's --ink-07 wash and
  a text cursor, gated behind `(hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` so a
  tap on a touch screen doesn't flash a hint at someone who can't
  double-click anyway. Both auto-size to their own text rather than sitting in a fixed-width
  box (a hidden same-font mirror span drives the width - see
  autoSizeTitleField in nav.js). The table title field's left edge
  lines up with the row card's own left edge below it (not the row's
  white Title pill, which sits inset inside that card by the card's own
  padding - a distinction that isn't obvious from a screenshot alone,
  confirmed by comparing getBoundingClientRect() on both in a live
  browser rather than trusting the rendered CSS by eye). Each
  entry is a card sitting on the dark panel, tinted with whatever color
  it's been given (or the plain light `--panel` fill if none) - the
  row's color lives only on the card's own background now, per a
  follow-up wireframe: a small colored dot opens the same shared color
  preset popover every other picker in the app uses (To Do's list
  color, Notes' card color) - the dot itself stays small at rest, but
  its actual click target is bigger than it looks and grows the dot to
  meet your cursor as you approach, so you don't have to land a click
  on an 8px circle - and both the Title and the Value/currency sit in
  their own fixed `#fafafa` field instead of directly on that color, so
  neither one needs to track it for contrast: Title text is always
  `#282828`, the "R$"-style currency prefix is always `#717171`, and
  the Value is always `#0fb54b` positive / `#c24236` negative / `#717171`
  zero-or-empty, regardless of what the card itself is tinted. The
  Title field sizes itself to its own text (a hidden same-font mirror
  span drives an absolutely-positioned input's width, updated on every
  keystroke) rather than filling the row, so it reads as a compact tag
  at the card's left edge; Toggle (Lucide circle-power) and Delete
  (Lucide trash-2) sit directly on the card's own color between the two
  fields, always visible now rather than a hover reveal, at a flat
  `#bdbdbd` regardless of the card's color - the one exception to the
  "give it its own fixed field" rule, since two small icons didn't
  need a third pill. Toggling a row off dims the whole card and blocks
  every field except the toggle and Delete from being clicked, and
  drops it from the Sum - for entries you want to keep on record
  without them counting. Both icons render at the same 16px,
  stroke-width:2 size as every other icon in the app (see "Design
  system notes" below) - Title and Value are the only two fields, fixed
  and permanent, with no custom-column feature. The Value is a
  text-only entry - a bare `type="number"` input's native up/down
  stepper is hidden, since this is a typed amount, not something
  incremented one unit at a time. One currency applies per table (the
  pill next to the title),
  matching Tracker's Day rate currency picker, so a running Sum at the
  bottom - a full-width total bar in the same light/shadowed card style
  - is always one coherent total: a negative Value just subtracts from
  it, being plain addition under the hood, and the Sum still counts
  every visible-and-active row even the ones collapsed behind "Show
  more" (rows past the 7th on a table cap there, same pattern as
  Projects's list). A dashed "+ Add row" card - matching Notes'
  add-note tile rather than a plain text link - creates a new one.
- **Documents** - a browser over a folder of PDFs somewhere on the
  computer, aimed squarely at invoices. Two fields in Settings drive
  it: **Documents path** (a folder) and **Search for** (comma-separated
  terms, e.g. `Invoice, Fatura`). VAIO walks that folder's whole tree -
  every level, not just the top - and indexes each `.pdf` whose own
  filename *or* any folder above it contains one of the terms. Either
  half matters: folder-only would miss a loose `Invoice 7.pdf`,
  filename-only would miss `fatura_003.pdf` sitting inside an
  `Invoices/` folder.

  **VAIO never writes to that folder.** Nothing under the Documents
  path is created, moved, renamed or deleted, ever - the folder tree
  stays the system of record and this page is a lens over it. The only
  bytes read are the first 64KB of each file, for a content hash. It is
  also not a PDF reader: clicking a row hands the file to the operating
  system's own viewer, and the ↗ button reveals it in Finder/Explorer
  instead.

  The result is a flat list, because flattening is the entire point -
  every invoice from every client in one column, narrowed by typing
  rather than by walking a tree. Rows are grouped under the client (or
  project) they belong to, sorted naturally so `Invoice 2` comes before
  `Invoice 10`, and the date column uses tabular figures at a fixed
  width so it reads as one straight edge. The search box filters the
  already-loaded index in memory and never touches the disk - the only
  thing that reads the folder is an explicit **Rescan**, or closing
  Settings after changing the path or terms. Filter chips for the
  groups and (when there is more than one) the years sit beside it, and
  the list caps to what fits the window with a "Show *n* more", the
  same pattern Projects and Calculator use.

  Tags are the manual layer on top: any row can carry any number of
  them, created inline in the row's ☆ popover and colored from the
  app's one color picker. **Tags are stored against the file's content
  hash, not its path** - so renaming an invoice or moving it to a
  different client folder outside the app keeps its tags attached after
  the next rescan.

  A file that has vanished from disk is marked missing rather than
  deleted, and a folder VAIO cannot read reports *why* ("that folder no
  longer exists", "check its permissions") instead of quietly showing
  an empty list - clearing a working index because a permissions prompt
  had not been answered yet is the failure mode that rule exists to
  prevent. Settings answers the same question while you are still
  typing, with a live "Matches 6 folders, 28 PDFs" under the fields.

Everything lands in a shared local SQLite database (`data/vaio.db`)
so it accumulates across sessions instead of being lost between runs.

## It opens in its own window, not a browser

VAIO is a local server rendering plain HTML, but you never see a browser:
`launcher.py` starts the server and hands its URL to a native window
(pywebview). On Windows that window is the WebView2 control that ships
with Edge, on macOS WKWebView, on Linux WebKitGTK - the OS's own web view,
so nothing extra to install and no second browser engine bundled. No
address bar, no tabs, and the taskbar entry says VAIO.

Closing the window stops the server. The server thread is a daemon and
pywebview owns the main thread, so there is nothing left running
afterwards.

Two fallbacks, both deliberate:

- **No native window available** (a Linux box with no WebKitGTK) - it
  opens your browser instead and says so. A worse-looking app beats no app.
- **Port 8501 already in use** - it takes any free port instead of dying
  with "address already in use", and the window is told which.

Set `VAIO_BROWSER=1` to force the browser, which is what you want while
editing the frontend, since the window has no devtools.

## Two ways to run this

- **Download VAIO.exe** (Windows) - nothing to install, no Python, no
  terminal. This is the normal way to use it.
- **Build it yourself** - if you're on Mac/Linux, or want a build of code
  you just changed.
- **From source** - venv + a run script. Only worth it while you're
  actively editing the app, since changes take effect without a rebuild.
  This is the one that shows a console window; the other two do not.

All three open the same window and share the same local SQLite database.

### Option A: download the .exe (Windows)

Go to the repository's **Releases** page and download `VAIO.exe`. Put it
somewhere it can live - a folder in Documents, say, not the Downloads
folder - and double-click it. That's the whole install.

Nothing else is needed: Python, FastAPI and the frontend are all inside
that one file.

Two things to expect the first time:

- **"Windows protected your PC"**, a blue box, on first launch. That is
  SmartScreen reacting to a file that isn't code-signed - signing
  certificates are a paid yearly thing and this app doesn't have one.
  Click **More info** -> **Run anyway**. It asks once per machine.
- **A few seconds before the window appears.** A one-file build unpacks
  itself to a temp folder on each launch. It is not doing anything on the
  network - the app never leaves your machine.

VAIO keeps its data in a `data` folder created next to the .exe. That is
deliberate: copy the .exe *and* that folder to a USB stick or another
computer and your projects, notes and invoices come with it. Leave the
folder behind and the new machine starts empty.

**Updating does not lose anything.** Drop the new `VAIO.exe` in beside the
old one, replacing it, and leave the `data` folder alone. The database is
never rebuilt on launch, only migrated: `init_db()` adds new tables with
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and new fields with `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`,
so a new version attaches its features to the data you already have. The
one way to be confused is to run the new .exe from a *different* folder -
it makes a fresh empty database there, and the old one sits untouched
where you left it.

**Take a backup first anyway.** Settings -> Backup -> *Back up now* writes
a timestamped zip of the whole data folder into `data/backups`. There is
no restore button, on purpose: putting a backup back means closing VAIO,
opening the zip and copying `data/vaio.db` over the one beside the app,
which is three deliberate steps rather than one button that replaces
everything you have done since. Note the backups live beside the app, so
they die with the disk - copy one somewhere else if that is the risk you
care about.

The .exe is built by GitHub Actions on a real Windows machine
(`.github/workflows/build-windows.yml`) using the same flags
`build_app.bat` uses, and the workflow refuses to publish a build that
doesn't start - it launches the .exe and checks the app actually
responds before attaching it to the Release.

**To cut a new version:** push a tag beginning with `v`
(`git tag v1.1 && git push origin v1.1`). That builds and publishes.
Running the workflow by hand from the Actions tab builds it without
publishing, leaving the .exe as a downloadable artifact instead.

### Option B: build the app yourself

One-time build, on the same OS you'll actually use the app on (a build
made on Mac won't run on Windows and vice versa):

```bash
./build_app.sh      # Windows: build_app.bat / Mac: double-click build_app.command
```

This creates `dist/VAIO` (`dist/VAIO.exe` on
Windows) - a single self-contained file with Python and FastAPI bundled
in. Move it wherever you like and double-click it to launch; it opens in
its own window. The build is `--windowed`, so no console sits behind it.

Note the `--collect-all webview` flag in the build scripts: pywebview
picks its platform backend by name at runtime, so PyInstaller cannot find
it by following imports. Drop that flag and the built app still works but
silently opens a browser instead of its own window - which looks exactly
like the feature being broken.

Re-run the build script only when you change `requirements.txt` or pull
down new code - not for regular use.

### Option C: from source (for actively editing the code)

Just run:

```bash
./run.sh       # Windows: run.bat (double-click it) / Mac: run.command (double-click it)
```

**First time**, this sets itself up automatically - creates a virtual
environment and installs everything - which takes a minute or two.
**Every time after that**, it just starts the app straight away. Either
way, it opens in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`. Leave that
terminal window running while you work.

**Windows note:** if you're using PowerShell and see errors about
`source` not being recognized, or about running scripts being disabled -
ignore them and just double-click `run.bat` in File Explorer instead of
typing commands. `run.bat` handles all of this correctly on its own.

**Testing a code change:** frontend files (`frontend/index.html`,
`frontend/static/**`) are served straight from disk - edit, save, and
just refresh the browser tab, no restart needed, on any OS.

Backend files (`server.py`, `api/*.py`, `storage/*.py`): on Mac/Linux,
`run.sh` passes uvicorn `--reload`, which watches those files and
restarts the server automatically on save. `run.bat` does **not** use
`--reload`, staying conservative around a known class of issue where its
subprocess-based file watcher doesn't correctly inherit an active venv
on some Windows setups. So on Windows, a backend edit needs a manual
restart: `Ctrl+C` in the `run.bat` window, then run it again.

Both `run.sh` and `run.bat` re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
every time (not just the first time `.venv` is created) - a plain-satisfied
install is a fast no-op, and this is what actually picks up a
`requirements.txt` change (like a new dependency) into an existing venv.
An earlier version of these scripts only installed once, which meant
pulling a change that added a new dependency didn't actually install it
into a venv from before that change - the fix is on both scripts now.

## Project layout

- `server.py` - FastAPI app: mounts the frontend and the API routers.
  This is the whole "navigation shell" - the extension point for a new
  tool is one new file under `api/`, one under `frontend/static/js/`,
  and one `<button class="sb-item">` + `<section>` in
  `frontend/index.html`.
- `api/gatherer.py`, `api/tracker.py`, `api/todo.py` - HTTP routes per
  tool, wrapping the storage logic below. `api/tracker.py` also owns
  reading/writing uploaded Docs files on disk (under
  `data/project_docs/<project_id>/`), since that's specific to Tracker
  rather than shared storage logic.
- `api/overview.py` - read-only routes: the header search bar's
  cross-tool title search, plus the stats endpoint powering Command
  Center's Full Board (counts, due-soon, recent-notes, today's-focus,
  active-projects, notes-preview) - aggregates the other tools' tables,
  doesn't own any of its own. Quick capture and the Today's Focus
  checkbox don't add new routes - they call the existing Notes/To Do
  endpoints directly.
- `tools/import_notion_studio_logs.py` - one-off migration: reads a
  Notion database exported as HTML and appends its rows to Studio Logs.
  Reads the HTML export rather than the CSV one because Notion writes the
  date as `<time datetime="2026-03-27">` there, while the CSV keeps only
  the display text ("March 27, 2026") that would have to be re-parsed
  against a locale. Columns are matched by their header text, not their
  position, so a differently-ordered export still lands correctly. It is
  safe to re-run - a row whose URL is already in the table is skipped
  rather than duplicated (URL, not title: two studios can share a name,
  and one export had two called "Icon") - and it copies the database to a
  `.bak` beside itself before the first write. `--dry-run` reports without
  writing. Nothing in the app imports this; it exists to be run by hand.
- `frontend/index.html` - the whole page shell (every tool's markup
  lives here, shown/hidden by `nav.js`).
- `frontend/static/css/app.css` - design tokens + all component styles.
- `frontend/static/js/nav.js` - shared page navigation (which page
  section is visible inside `.ct-card` and which `.sb-item` is marked
  active), the custom dropdown component, and a themed `confirmDialog()`
  (used in place of the browser's native `confirm()` for every delete
  action) - loaded first since every tool depends on it.
- `frontend/static/js/gatherer.js`, `frontend/static/js/tracker.js`,
  `frontend/static/js/todo.js` - one file per tool, no shared state
  between them beyond `nav.js`'s `$()`.
- `frontend/static/js/overview.js` - Overview's Full Board
  rendering (quick capture, Today's Focus, Due Soon, Active Projects,
  Recent Notes, Notes preview) and the header search bar's logic;
  reuses `openProjectModal`/`selectTodoList`+`openTodoTaskModal`/
  `openNoteModal` from the other tools' own files to open a detail view
  on click, the same functions a search jump already used, rather than
  duplicating that logic.
- `api/documents.py` - Documents' routes plus the app-wide settings
  store (`GET`/`PUT /settings`). Its literal segments (`/rescan`,
  `/open`, `/tags`) are declared *before* any `/{id}` route, because
  FastAPI matches in definition order - the other way round, "rescan"
  is parsed as a file id and rejected as a bad int. `POST /open`
  re-resolves the stored path and checks it is still under the
  documents folder before handing anything to the OS, so a stale or
  crafted id cannot open something outside it.
- `storage/docscan.py` - the folder walk. Strictly read-only: no
  function in it opens a file for writing. Also owns the natural sort
  key (digit runs zero-padded to a fixed width, so it stays a TEXT
  column SQLite can `ORDER BY` directly) and the group heuristic.
- `frontend/static/js/documents.js` - the Documents page and the
  Settings modal.
- `storage/db.py` - shared SQLite layer any tool can write into.
- `app_paths.py` - where persistent data lives on disk.

## Data model

SQLite (`data/vaio.db`, next to `server.py` or next to the packaged
executable), shared across every tool:

- `gatherer_entries` - title, url, type (Studio/Company), status
  (Sent/Not sent), sent_date, created_at, updated_at. Gatherer's own
  table.
- `projects` - title, description, status (Active/Completed), paid
  (Paid/Unpaid), client, deadline, day_rate, currency
  (USD/EUR/GBP/BRL), assets_text/notes_text/briefing_text (the side
  panel's three tabs), position (manual drag order within a status
  view), created_at, updated_at. Tracker's own table.
- `project_docs` - project_id, filename (original name shown in the UI),
  stored_name (the collision-proofed name it's actually saved as on
  disk), uploaded_at. The files themselves live under
  `data/project_docs/<project_id>/`, not in the database - this table
  just points at them.
- `project_tasks` - project_id, task, status (Active/Done), duration
  (Full/Half/Custom), cost, observation (only usable when duration is
  Custom), task_date, created_at, updated_at. Backs a project's Log
  table.
- `personal_projects` - title, description, status (Active/Completed),
  assets_text/notes_text/references_text (the side panel's three
  tabs), position (manual drag order within a status view), created_at,
  updated_at. A separate, simpler table from `projects` - no
  client/deadline/day rate/docs/tasks, since personal projects don't
  bill anyone.
- `personal_checklist_items` - personal_project_id, text, checked,
  created_at, updated_at. Backs a personal project's Checklist.
- `todo_lists` - title, favorite, color, created_at, updated_at. To
  Do's lists.
- `todo_tasks` - list_id, title, completed, important, notes,
  position (manual create-order, newest on top), created_at,
  updated_at. A list's tasks.
- `todo_steps` - task_id, text, checked, created_at, updated_at. Backs
  a task's Steps mini-checklist.
- `notes` - body, type ('text' or 'list', mutable via the modal's toggle
  button), color, position (manual drag order), created_at, updated_at.
  Notes' own table, a flat board (no lists/nesting). Still has a `title`
  column for schema compatibility, but the frontend no longer reads or
  writes it - display everywhere derives a short label from `body`'s
  first line, or a list's first item text, instead.
- `note_items` - note_id, text, checked, created_at, updated_at. Backs
  a 'list'-type note's checklist.
- `finance_tables` - title, currency, position, created_at, updated_at.
  One row per Calculator tab - each tab is fully independent, with its
  own rows and currency.
- `finance_rows` - table_id, title, value, color, active, created_at,
  updated_at. A table's own rows - Title, Value, an optional row color,
  and the on/off toggle are fixed columns on the row itself.
- `finance_columns` / `finance_cells` - **dropped.** These backed a
  freeform-column feature (an extra column per table, with per-row values
  in `finance_cells` as an EAV side table) that was removed, leaving them
  unreachable. `init_db()` now drops both on startup, so an older local
  database cleans itself up on first run.
- `app_settings` - key, value, updated_at. A generic key/value store
  for app-wide settings, currently `documents_path` and
  `documents_terms`. Deliberately not a one-row settings table with a
  column per option: a new setting is then a new row, not a migration.
- `document_files` - path, filename, display_name, sort_key, folder,
  group_name, size_bytes, mtime, year, content_hash, missing,
  indexed_at. The Documents index - a cache of what the scan found, not
  a system of record, so it can be thrown away and rebuilt by a rescan.
  A file that has disappeared is flagged `missing` rather than deleted.
- `document_tags` - name (unique), color, created_at. Tags are global,
  not per-file, so the same "Paid" means the same thing everywhere. New
  tags reuse an existing name that differs only in case: the UNIQUE
  index is case-sensitive, so without that "Paid" typed over an
  existing "paid" quietly becomes a second tag meaning the same thing.
- `document_file_tags` - kind, path, tag_id. **Keyed by where the file
  is, not by what is in it.** It was keyed by content hash originally, so
  that a tag would survive a rename outside the app - but two byte-identical
  files share a hash, and tagging one silently tagged every copy, across
  Invoices and NF's both. Renames are followed at scan time instead, and
  only when unambiguous: one file gone, one file arrived, same hash.

**Type and Status are a closed pair each, and an importer has to respect
that.** `gatherer_entries.type` and `.status` are free text in SQLite but
two-option `<select>`s in the UI, so a third value is not stored-but-unshown
- it renders as the *first* option while the database says something else,
and the first edit to that row writes the displayed value back, losing the
original silently. The Notion import folds on the way in for that reason
(Agency and Store/Company to Company; Studio/Individual and VFX House to
Studio) and prints every row it changed. Anything else writing these columns
needs the same discipline.

## Roadmap / not built yet

Open threads on things that already exist. There are no small ones left
at the moment - the list below was worked through, and what remains is
either decided against or a real piece of work.

Settled, so nobody reopens them:

- **Exporting an invoice straight into the Invoices folder** is not
  happening. The browser can only make a PDF through its own print dialog
  and JavaScript cannot choose a destination folder, so it would take a
  server-side headless renderer and a browser download on first run. The
  print dialog is the export, by decision and not by omission.
- **Invoice rows are not reorderable**, and the code that could have done
  it has been removed rather than left dangling. An invoice is typed top
  to bottom; the only thing a drag could do is silently reorder something
  already checked.
- **Uncoloured Calculator rows** read flat in light mode and that is
  fine - it was looked at and left alone.

- Roadmap of possible future tools/pages, not yet designed:
  - Lead pipeline (Lead → Quoted → Won/Lost), upstream of Project
    Manager, for prospecting before a job is active.
  - Wiring the invoice editor to the rest of the app: filling a new
    invoice's rows from a project's Log instead of typing them, and
    auto-incrementing the invoice number from the last one. (The editor
    and the browser both exist now - this is the join between them, and
    it is deliberately absent: every field is typed by hand today.)
  - Documents, phase two: linking an indexed invoice to a Tracker
    project, reconciling it against that project's Log rows, reading
    amounts and dates out of the PDF itself (`pypdf`), and CSV export
    for an accountant.
  - Asset & reference library - tagged textures, HDRIs, rigs, and
    moodboard images per project, distinct from Notes.
  - Render job tracker - job, cost, status, output per render-farm or
    local render job.
  - Time tracking per project, feeding the existing day-rate math.
  - Software/subscription tracker (renewal dates, cost) alongside
    Calculator.
  - Client contact log - last contacted / next follow-up, attached to
    a Studio Database entry or project.
  - Portfolio/reel manager - what's currently in the demo reel and
    site, versioned, with a "last updated" nudge.
  - Quote/estimate builder - hours × day rate × complexity multiplier,
    a "before the job" companion to Calculator's "after the job" ledger.
  - Contract/NDA template library with client-specific fields to fill in.
  - Job board watcher - a feed of new listings, in spirit the successor
    to this app's original scraper, aimed at leads instead of studios.
  - Rate card - a reference page of service packages and prices.
  - Deliverables checklist per project (file format, texture
    resolution, UDIM layout, poly budget, naming convention).
  - Revision-round tracker - how many rounds a contract includes vs.
    how many have been used.
  - Deadline calendar view - a date-based alternate view of Project
    Manager's rows instead of a flat table.

## Design system notes

**The invoice editor holds no numbers, only text.** Every field on an
invoice is a TEXT column and nothing anywhere totals, rounds or reformats.
The invoice this was built from writes `1 / 2` days, `$300,00` rates,
`April 09/10` dates and a total the user decides; a form that insisted on
numbers would fight all of that and win nothing. The grand total is a field
like any other.

**Sort by what the column is showing, and be strict about reading it.**
All three sections on Documents - the invoices written here, plus Invoices
and NFs on disk - carry the same Name/Date chips at the same right edge
(`SORT_CARET` is shared in nav.js so a caret cannot mean "ascending" in
one and "descending" in another). Clicking the active chip reverses it;
switching chips resets the direction to suit the key, since dates want
newest first and names want A to Z.

Reading a *typed* date is where the care goes. An invoice's date is free
text, and `Date.parse` will read almost anything - it turns `April 09/10`
into 9 April **2010** and `1 / 2` into 2 January 2001, both years nobody
typed. The danger is silent misreading, not failure. So a typed date is
only trusted when it names a four-digit year *and* parses to that same
year; everything else falls back to `created_at`, which is a real date, so
the list stays sorted by date throughout rather than dropping an invoice
into 1970. `April 9-10, 2026` is the case that proves the year check earns
its keep - it has a full year, and `Date.parse` still reads it as 2010.

**Export is `window.print()` over a hidden layout, not a second renderer.**
`#invoice-print` is rendered from the invoice, `body` gets
`.printing-invoice`, and the print stylesheet hides everything that is not
that element. No new dependency, and the print preview is the output.

Two traps in there. `#invoice-print` is positioned off-screen rather than
`display: none` - a hidden element has no layout, so the browser has
nothing to paginate and the print comes out blank. And Export blurs the
focused field first: the blur handler is what saves, so exporting straight
after typing would otherwise print the value from before the last edit.

**`overflow: hidden` zeroes a flex item's minimum size.** `.settings-group`
carries it for the border radius, and inside the modal's flex column that
let the group shrink *below its own content* on a short window rather than
pushing the modal past its `max-height`. The group clipped its last fields,
and since the modal then never overflowed there was nothing to scroll to
reach them - the fields were simply gone. `flex-shrink: 0` is what makes the
modal scroll instead. Measured at an 800px window: the group was 588px tall
around 692px of content, with `scrollHeight === clientHeight` on the modal.

**Nothing personal ships with the app.** The "invoice from" block, the
payment notes, the contact line, the Wise link and @ and the payment image
all start empty, with the form's placeholders saying what goes in each. A
seeded default would mean a name, a home address, bank and routing numbers
and a phone number living in this repository and its history forever - so
they are typed once into Settings and stay on the machine that typed them.

**Settings holds defaults, not a live include.** A new invoice copies the
"invoice from" block, the payment notes and the contact line out of
Settings; editing them later changes the next invoice, never one already
written. An invoice is a record of what was sent, so a bank detail changing
today must not rewrite what a client received last year.

**A textarea cannot hold a link, so the note body is two elements.** The
modal keeps `#note-modal-body` as the only editor and puts
`#note-modal-view` in front of it - a div rendering the same text with real
anchors. Click a link and it opens; click anywhere else and the textarea
swaps in with the caret where you clicked (`caretPositionFromPoint`, then
sum the lengths of the text nodes before it to get the plain-text index).
Blur saves and swaps back, so a link you just typed is live immediately.

Three things keep the swap from showing. Both elements share
`.note-modal-plain`, so font, line-height and padding cannot drift apart.
The view needs `white-space: pre-wrap` to reproduce a textarea's newlines
and space runs. And the textarea auto-grows to its content - without that,
a long note collapses from its full height into a 220px scroller the moment
you click into it.

`linkifyHtml` in nav.js escapes first and builds the anchors from the
escaped pieces, so a note's own body can never inject markup. The URL
pattern is deliberately narrow - `http(s)://` and bare `www.` only. Anything
loose enough to catch `vaio.app` also catches `e.g.`, and a false link
mid-sentence is worse than a missed one. Trailing `.,;:!?` is given back to
the sentence; brackets only when unbalanced, so a `..._(disambiguation)`
link survives.

Links use `--link`, not `--accent-blue`: at 14px on the light panel the
accent measures 4.32:1, under the 4.5:1 normal text needs. On a *coloured*
note card they inherit `currentColor` instead and let the underline carry
the affordance - the card's background is whatever the user picked, and no
fixed blue is readable against all of them. Same reasoning as
`.note-card-light` / `.note-card-dark`.

**Disclosures are `grid-template-rows: 0fr -> 1fr`, and the padding goes on
a child.** Documents stacks two sections (Invoices, NFs) and Settings
stacks its groups, so both collapse. The grid-row trick animates to the
content's own height with no JavaScript measuring it, and no `max-height`
guess that either clips a long list or stalls on a short one.

The trap is that an element's own padding sits *inside* its own
`overflow: hidden`, so padding on the grid item leaves the collapsed
section that many pixels tall - an 18px sliver under a closed group. The
item does the clipping (`overflow: hidden; min-height: 0`) and a child
inside it carries the padding. `#settings-docs-fields` is that child.

The corollary is that **every settings group needs its own wrapper**, and a
group written without one gets no inset at all rather than a default. Backup
shipped that way: its children sat flush against the group's border - the
button touching the left edge, the restore note touching the bottom one -
and 14px left of the caret in its own header. `.backup-fields` is now its
wrapper, on the same `2px 14px 16px` as Documents, so the two groups line
their content up with each other. The wrapper stacks with one `gap` rather
than a margin per block, which is what lets the status line disappear when
empty (`.backup-status:empty { display: none }`) without leaving a hole -
a `display: none` flex child takes its gap with it.

That status line used to reserve a blank row at all times so the list below
would not shift when a message arrived. It was not worth it: the message
always arrives together with a new row in that same list, so the shift
happened anyway and the reservation only bought a permanent 28px gap under
the buttons.

**Two kinds, one template.** Invoices and NFs are the same browser pointed
at two folders, so the page renders one section template twice from the
kind list the server sends, and all view state (`docView`) is keyed by
kind. Nothing in `documents.js` names "invoice" or "nf" except the default
that decides which one starts open.

The section shells are built **once** and only their lists re-render.
Rebuilding the shell on every keystroke would replace the search `<input>`
under the cursor and throw away focus and caret position mid-word.

**Everything about an index is per kind.** `document_files` is keyed
`UNIQUE (kind, path)`, not `UNIQUE (path)`: the two folders can legitimately
overlap, and with one row per path whichever scan ran second would steal
the row from the first. Rescan, the missing-file sweep and the
outside-the-folder check in `POST /open` are all scoped the same way - an
invoice rescan must not mark every NF missing, and an NF path must not be
validated against the invoice root.

The one thing deliberately **shared** across kinds is the tag vocabulary:
"Paid" means the same thing on either, and a per-kind list would be the
same list maintained twice. Tag *assignments* are per file.

**Tags hang off (kind, path), not off the file's bytes.** Hash-keying was
tried first, so a tag would follow a renamed or moved invoice. It does not
survive contact with a real folder: `_hash_file` is the size plus the first
64KB, duplicates are ordinary here ("NF_XDS - Copy (2)"), and byte-identical
files therefore share a hash - so tagging one silently tagged every copy,
across both kinds, since a hash carries no kind either.

Following a rename is now done in `replace_document_index`, and only where
it cannot be wrong: if exactly one path with hash H vanished in this scan
and exactly one new path with the same H appeared, that is a rename and the
tags move. With copies in play neither side is a single path, the rule does
not fire, and the tag is dropped rather than guessed at.

That check is why `before` must exclude rows already marked `missing`.
Including them made `gone` cumulative - every file that had ever vanished
reappeared in it on every scan - which both reported a forever-growing
"N missing" in the status line and gave the rename check four candidate
sources where there was one.

**The filename and its folder share one grid cell.** The folder label is
empty when a kind has only one group, and a `display: none` grid item does
not leave a blank column behind - it shifts every column after it, so the
dates and buttons would slide one place left on exactly those lists. Inside
a flex parent, `display: none` on an empty label takes its `gap` with it
and nothing else moves. The folder is also the side that gives way when the
row runs out of room (`flex: 1 1 auto` against the name's `0 1 auto`): a
folder you can only half read still tells two identical filenames apart, a
filename cut short does not.

**The list is flat; grouping lives in the filter chips.** A file's group is
the first folder above it that is neither a bare year nor named after a
search term. That is a decent guess at "which client", and a poor one at
"what deserves a heading": a tree with one file per folder turned into a
header above every single row. So no group headers, in any view. Files
still arrive sorted by group, so one client's files stay adjacent - they
are just not fenced off from each other, and the chips narrow to one
group when you want that.

The chips themselves only appear when there is more than one group, since
files sitting loose in the folder you nominated resolve to no group at all
and a lone "Ungrouped" chip beside "All" filters nothing. `docIsGrouped()`
gates them, and `docVisibleFiles` ignores a stale group selection when it
returns false - otherwise a rescan that flattens a tree empties the list
with no chip left on screen to explain why.

**The list caps at a fixed 10, not at what fits the window.** Every other
long list here uses `applyRowFit`; two stacked sections have no single
"what fits" answer, and a list whose length changes when you resize the
window is worse than one you can predict.

**`.btn-text` needs the full `border` shorthand, not just `border-color`.**
It set `border-color: transparent` and nothing else, so a `<button>` kept the
UA default `2px outset`. Invisible while it is transparent, and harmless
while `.btn-text` is what it was built to be - a full-width toggle standing
alone under a list - but it makes the box 2px taller and 4px wider than a
`.btn` with identical padding, so the two can never share an edge when they
sit in a row together. That is what left "Open backups folder" floating
inside "Back up now" instead of beside it. Same family as the other traps
here: a shared class carrying an assumption from where it was born.

The wider rule for putting a `.btn-text` next to a `.btn`: give it the
`.btn`'s whole box - same padding, radius, font size and border - and leave
out only the fill. The matching geometry is what puts the two on one top and
bottom edge; the empty background is what keeps the primary reading as the
primary, so the pair needs no size or weight difference to say which is
which. Hover follows `.btn` and moves `border-color` only - a fill appearing
on hover would undo the one thing separating them.

**One icon size, one delete icon.** Every small icon button in the app is
a 16px Lucide glyph centred in a 24px box: `.row-delete-btn`,
`.note-delete-btn`, `.doc-delete-btn`, `.doc-tag-delete`, `.doc-row-action`,
`.url-open-link` and Calculator's `.finance-card-delete` /
`.finance-card-toggle`. Calculator set that geometry first and the rest
follow it, so a delete weighs the same in a table row, a note card and a
tag list. The icons themselves live in nav.js (`ICON_TRASH_SVG`,
`ICON_ARROW_UP_RIGHT_SVG`, `ICON_TAG_SVG`) rather than being re-typed per
file - inline SVG, not an icon font, because the app has to work offline.

Two traps sit in that block. The size lives in a shared `svg { }` rule
because none of those button rules set an svg size themselves, so there is
nothing for it to collide with wherever they appear in the file - the box
geometry, which *does* collide, is written into each rule instead. And a
text glyph and an SVG cannot share a row: sizing a `&times;` means
`font-size` and `padding`, sizing an icon means `width`/`height`, so
converting one button in a row means converting all of them or the two
will not align.

Delete buttons keep whichever colour treatment their surface already had:
neutral at rest and red on hover nearly everywhere, always-red only on
note cards, where the button sits alone in the card footer with nothing to
hover first.

**Notes is a grid, not CSS multi-column, and that is about reading order.**
Multi-column fills column-major - all the way down column one, then down
column two - so a new note appeared beneath the first card while the space
to its right sat empty, and what you read on screen did not match the order
the notes are actually in (or the order drag-reorder writes back). A grid
with `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(240px, 1fr))` fills row-major instead.

`align-items: start` is the line that keeps the masonry feel. Without it
every card stretches to its row's height, so a two-line note beside a
checklist becomes a tall empty box. With it each card keeps its own height
and a row is simply as tall as its tallest card. The card's old
`margin-bottom` had to go at the same time - that was the multi-column
layout's row gap, and leaving it alongside the grid's `gap` doubles the
space between rows.

**A --windowed build has no stdout, and that breaks more than print().**
PyInstaller's windowed mode gives the program `sys.stdout` and
`sys.stderr` of `None`. Guarding our own `print()` was not enough: uvicorn's
`Config.__init__` calls `logging.config.dictConfig` on a formatter that
inspects `sys.stdout` to decide about colour, and raises
`ValueError: Unable to configure formatter 'default'` before the server
binds a port. The server thread died on its first line, the window opened
onto nothing, and with no console the traceback had nowhere to go - the
app just looked broken.
`launcher.py` now points the missing streams at the null device *before
uvicorn is imported*, which is why that repair sits above the imports
rather than inside a function. Anything else that assumes the streams
exist is fixed by the same line.
This is the class of bug that only appears in the packaged build on the
target OS: `--windowed` is a no-op on Linux, so every local test passed.
The build workflow's smoke test is what caught it - it launches the built
.exe and fails the job if the app never answers, which is the only reason
it was found before a release went out rather than after. `VAIO_DEBUG=1`
makes the launcher write `vaio-launch.log` beside the executable; the
workflow dumps it on failure, and it is the first thing to ask for if the
app ever refuses to open on someone's machine.

**Copy a live SQLite file and you can get a torn one.** The backup in
Settings uses `sqlite3`'s own backup API rather than `shutil.copy`, and
the difference only shows up in the case that matters: the app is always
running when the button is pressed, and a plain copy taken mid-write can
produce a file that opens fine and is missing the last thing you did - or
that will not open at all. The backup API takes a consistent snapshot of a
database being written to. The copy is verified by `PRAGMA integrity_check`
in testing, which is the check worth repeating if this ever changes.
The zip holds the uploaded files too, not just the database. A backup with
the invoice row but not the payment image, or the project but not its
briefing PDF, is one that only looks complete until you need it.

**An absolutely-positioned close button owns the corner it sits in, so
the top row has to give it up.** `.modal-close` floats in the modal's
top-right; every top row that stretched the full width ran underneath it -
14x12px of overlap in Projects, Personal Projects, To Do, Settings and the
invoice editor. It read badly, and it *behaved* badly: the title field's
own top-right corner belonged to the button, so clicking there to place a
caret closed the modal. `elementFromPoint` at the field's corner returned
`modal-close`, which is the check worth repeating - overlap you can see is
a nuisance, overlap that steals a click is a bug.
Stretching top rows now reserve `--modal-close-gutter`, landing 45px from
the modal's right edge - the clearance the note modal's toggle button
already had, being the one top row that never collided. Written as
`.modal-close + <specific>` rather than `.modal-close + *`, because a
sibling that sizes to its own content does not need the gutter and would
only be pushed off-centre by it.
The margin alone was not enough for the title field, and the reason is
worth remembering: the generic `input[type="text"]` rule gives it
`width: 100%`, and under `border-box` a percentage width is measured
against the container whatever the element's own margins are - so the box
kept its full width and the margin just added dead space. `width: auto`
hands sizing back to the flex column, which stretches to the container
minus margins. Third time an element-qualified generic rule has quietly
won an argument in this stylesheet; check for one whenever a width or a
padding you set appears to do nothing.

**An icon's box is wider than its ink, so a gap next to one is not the
gap you set.** The brand asterisk's ink stops 4.4px short of its own 19px
`<svg>` box; a nav icon's stops 1.3px short of its 16px box. So the
wordmark's 8px gap measured 12.4px of real air while the nav items' 10px
gap measured 11.3px - the smaller CSS number looked *further apart*, which
is exactly what got reported. It is now 4px, for ~8.4px optical, reading
as one lockup rather than another row of the list. When something beside
an icon looks wrong by a couple of pixels, measure the ink (`getBBox()`
plus half the stroke width, scaled by box width over viewBox width), not
the element.

**A height set from `scrollHeight` is short by the border.** Everything
here is `box-sizing: border-box` (the `*` rule), so a height covers
content, padding *and* border - but `scrollHeight` only reports content
and padding. `autoGrowChecklistText` assigned one straight to the other
for a long time, which left every auto-growing textarea in the app - To Do
steps, note bodies and items, invoice cells - exactly two pixels shy of
its own text. Nothing looked broken, because a single line has enough
leading to absorb 2px; it only surfaced when a field of this kind had to
sit flush beside a `<div>` sized the normal way and the two disagreed. The
helper now adds the border widths back on.

**A `<textarea>` cannot contain a link, so anything with clickable links
in it is two elements.** The note body and each list item of a list note
keep a textarea and a rendered view of the same text, and swap. Three
things make the swap invisible: the view carries the same classes as the
textarea it stands in for, so the two boxes are one box by construction
rather than two sets of numbers kept in step by hand; `white-space:
pre-wrap` makes the view render a textarea's text identically, runs of
spaces and all; and `textOffsetInView` (nav.js) maps the click back to a
plain-text index by walking text nodes, so the caret lands where you
clicked instead of at the end - across an anchor boundary too. `mousedown`
does the swap, not `click`, and it returns early inside `.note-link` so a
link stays a link.
One deliberate asymmetry: the body always swaps to a view, but a list item
only does so once it actually contains a link. A checklist is tabbed
through and typed into, and making every row cost a click to focus would
tax the common case to serve the rare one.
Contrast is tighter here than on the note body: `--link` on `--panel-alt`
(the field's own fill) measures 4.61:1 in light and 6.79:1 in dark, so it
passes AA but has little room. Re-measure before darkening `--panel-alt`.

**A heading is a promise about the query behind it.** Overview's Due Soon
panel and the Due Soon toast are two surfaces for one question, and they
answered it differently - the toast used a 2-day window, the panel had no
date filter at all and just listed the five soonest dated tasks, so a task
due in three months sat under a heading that says "Due Soon". Both now go
through `DUE_SOON_DAYS` in db.py. Where two places name the same thing,
the window they mean by it belongs in one constant, not in each query.

**Show a modal before you fill it, not after.** `openNoteModal` set
`display: flex` as its last statement, after building the content - and a
list note's items are `<textarea rows="1">` grown to their own
`scrollHeight` by `autoGrowChecklistText`. An element inside a
`display: none` parent measures zero, so every item collapsed and its text
came out clipped. The modal is shown first now; nothing paints between two
JavaScript statements, so there is no flash of the previous note. This is
the same trap the fit-to-window caps hit, in a different place - anything
that measures itself has to run after its container is laid out.

The To Do task modal had the identical bug and it shipped for months
before anyone noticed, because a one-line step looks fine either way -
`openTodoTaskModal` called `renderTodoSteps` and only then set
`display: flex`, so every step's textarea was written `height: 0px` and
rendered 16px tall against a real content height of 32px (50px for a step
that wraps). Worth knowing how to check this: `offsetHeight` alone tells
you nothing, and `scrollHeight > clientHeight` gives a false positive
because `clientHeight` excludes padding. Force `height: auto`, read
`scrollHeight`, put the height back - if that number is bigger than
`offsetHeight`, the field is clipped. If a fourth place turns up, the
answer is the same one: show it, then fill it.

**Reordering is FLIP, and the thing in your hand is not dimmed.** Native
HTML5 drag reorders by calling `insertBefore`, which is instant - every
item that is not being dragged teleports to its new slot. `flipReorder` /
`flipInsert` in nav.js bridge that: measure (First), let the DOM change
(Last), put everything back with a transform (Invert), release it and let
CSS carry it home (Play). Notes, Projects, Personal Projects and both To Do
drags share the one helper.

Two details in there are easy to get wrong. It wraps the *mutation*, not
the `dragover` event - dragover fires on every mouse move, while
insertBefore only changes anything when the pointer crosses a midpoint, so
wrapping the event instead would thrash. And the release needs **two**
nested `requestAnimationFrame`s: with one, the browser coalesces the invert
and the release into a single style recalculation and nothing animates.

**The app does not use native HTML5 drag, and the reason is worth keeping
written down.** The item that follows the cursor in an HTML5 drag is a
snapshot drawn by the browser's compositor, and it is composited
translucent. It is not the source element, so no CSS in the page reaches
it - setting `opacity: 1` on what you grabbed does nothing, because that is
not the thing you are looking at. The only way to hold a solid item is to
draw it yourself.

So `startPointerDrag` (nav.js) runs the whole gesture on pointer events:
`.drag-ghost` is a real cloned node following the pointer at full opacity
with a shadow, and `.drag-source` is the original left in the list, faded
to `0.35` as a slot showing where it will land. A 4px threshold before the
drag begins is what keeps a plain click on a card still opening it.

Two traps in there. `body > .drag-ghost` needs the child combinator: the
ghost is a clone and carries its original's classes, and `.note-card`,
`.kcard` and `.kanban-col` all set `position: relative` in rules further
down the file. At equal specificity source order wins, so a plain
`.drag-ghost { position: fixed }` lost and the ghost was laid out in flow
hundreds of pixels down the page, invisible while every measurement said
it existed. And a To Do column is dragged by a **grip**, not its header -
the header was tried first and the title input is `flex: 1`, so "the header
minus its controls" left a few pixels of target.

**The To Do board reorders in three directions**, which is why
`reorder_todo_tasks` takes a list id *and* the ids: on a Kanban board,
dropping a card into another column IS the reorder, so position and
`list_id` are written in the same statement rather than as two operations.
A cross-column drop writes both columns - the source needs its remaining
cards renumbered or a later insert collides with the gap the moved card
left. Columns drag by their header only (the sole part with no field or
button spanning it) and cards drag by their whole body, minus the checkbox,
which would otherwise be undraggable-over and untickable near the edges.

`todo_lists` gained `position` by the same additive migration `favorite`
and `color` used, seeded from the id order the board was already showing,
so an existing board looks identical the first time it runs.

One route-ordering trap: `/lists/reorder` must be declared **above**
`/lists/{list_id}`. FastAPI matches in definition order, so the other way
round "reorder" is parsed as a list id and rejected as a bad int.

**Motion has a token block too, and the same rule.** `--ease-out`,
`--ease-in-out`, the `--dur-*` tier list and the two `--press-scale`
values live beside the colors; no curve or duration literal belongs
anywhere else. `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` was hand-typed in three
places before this existed - it is the strong ease-out that the built-in
keyword is too weak to give, and it is now named once.

Two decisions in there are worth not undoing. The durations are a tier
list rather than a scale: press is fastest because it has to feel like the
click itself, and exit is deliberately quicker than enter, because on the
way in you are waiting to see something and on the way out you have
already decided. And `--press-scale` is a token rather than a literal
purely so `prefers-reduced-motion` can flip it to `1` in one place -
reduced motion drops the movement and keeps the color fades, which is the
"fewer and gentler, not none" reading.

The two tactility rules near the top of `app.css` are explicit selector
lists on purpose. A blanket `button` or `*` transition is `transition: all`
one level up: it animates things nobody chose to animate and the cost
surfaces somewhere unrelated later. They sit early in the file so any
component wanting different timing just declares its own `transition` and
wins on source order - `.sb-item` and the Calculator title both do.

Two things that were measured before any of it was written: 53 of the
file's 56 hover rules were hard cuts, and the whole stylesheet held
exactly one `:active` rule, which was a `cursor: grabbing`. If either
number creeps back up, the app is drifting back to feeling flat.

`scale()` is relative, so one press value cannot serve a 120px button and
a 22px icon - 0.97 on a 22px control is two thirds of a pixel. Hence two
tiers. Content cards and table rows are deliberately not pressable: they
contain their own buttons, so pressing a delete icon would scale its whole
card, and a scaled table row breaks its own column alignment.

Closing a modal needs JS (`closeModalAnimated`, nav.js) because nothing
can animate an element that is already `display: none`. Three details in
there are load-bearing: `animationend` bubbles, so the handler checks
`e.target === backdrop` or the inner panel's own animation closes the
modal; a timeout backstop guarantees the modal ends up hidden even if the
animation never reports finishing, because losing an exit animation is a
blemish while a modal that will not close is a broken app; and that
timeout reads `--dur-modal-out` from the stylesheet rather than repeating
it, so it cannot start cutting the exit short when the CSS changes.

**Two themes, one rule: no color literal outside the token block.** Every
color in `app.css` is a named token defined twice - once on `:root` (light,
warm paper) and once on `:root[data-theme="dark"]` (warm charcoal). Adding
a color means adding a token with both values, not a hex where it is used.
Roughly seventy literals were spread through the stylesheet before dark
mode; they are gone, and the two blocks are checked for parity (same token
names on both sides) rather than by eye.

There are three sanctioned exceptions. Two are in Notes: the
`.note-card-light` / `.note-card-dark` ramps and, on Overview's note
chips, `.chip-dark-text` / `.chip-light-text` (the class names carry no
`note-` prefix - overview.js builds them as bare `chip-*`). Those inks are
chosen against the note's *own*
user-picked color, which does not change when the theme does, so they must
not follow the theme. The bug that proves the rule: the note chip on
Overview only had a class for the light-ink case, so a pale note fell
through to `--text` - fine on paper, invisible the moment `--text` went
pale. If a surface carries a user color, both ink cases need a class.

The third is the invoice print layout (`.pr-*`, near the bottom of the
stylesheet). That one is ink on paper: black on white whichever theme the
app is in, because a printed invoice is not a themed surface. Its literals
are deliberate and should stay literals - tokens there would make the
printout follow the screen, which is the opposite of what is wanted.

**A picked card color has to clear two rules that pull against each
other.** The picker's swatches tint a whole surface - a note, a To Do
list, a Calculator row - and a color is stored as one hex and painted on
both a `#fafafa` page and a `#1c1c1c` one. Rule one: stay under 5.5:1
against both grounds, which puts relative luminance in roughly
[0.15, 0.26]. (Under 4:1 against both is arithmetically impossible - the
grounds are too far apart.) Rule two: the text on the card, whose ink
`colorNeedsDarkText` picks, needs 4.5:1 - and mid-tone is the *worst*
place to be for that, since neither ink is far from it. The current ten
clear both, which cost the eight hues about 12% of their value; the two
neutrals sit slightly outside rule one on purpose, because "darker and
brighter grey" is a request for separation. Keep both checks, and keep
every hue clear of luma 0.55 where the ink flips and both inks are poor.

The pale tints the picker used to hold (`#C2E0CE`, `#88A8BF`) fail rule
one badly on charcoal. Colors already stored on existing rows still
render - they just are not offered any more.

Saturation, usefully, is free. Both rules are functions of relative
luminance alone, so chroma can be raised or dropped at fixed luminance and
neither check needs re-deriving - which is how the set went from muted to
its current 1.5x without another contrast pass. Only a change that moves
luminance needs the numbers run again.

**The dark greys are neutral, and that was a correction.** They shipped
warm first, mirroring the light theme's yellow-biased paper, on the theory
that the app should read as the same app with the lights off. In use it
read as a tan cast rather than as warmth - worst at small sizes, where
`--text-faint` on a panel looked like a third accent sitting next to the
real amber and green. The greys are now hue-free; the status hues were
never the problem and are untouched. One knock-on: dropping the tint costs
a grey some luminance, so `--text-faint` sits at `#7b7b7b` rather than the
`#76` the ramp wanted, which is what keeps the empty-state actions above
3:1 on `--panel-alt`.

Three relationships in the dark palette are deliberate and worth keeping:
panels always lift *toward* the light source (`--panel` is brighter than
`--bg` in both themes), `--panel-alt` inverts direction because its job is
"reads as a distinct surface" and that means recessing on paper but lifting
on charcoal, and `--accent` / `--accent-text` swap wholesale. Shadows do
not invert - there is no light shadow - they get darker and deeper. The ink
washes (`--ink-*`, used for hover tints and zebra stripes) do invert, and
land a little heavier, because a 3% wash disappears on charcoal.

A token that means "a surface on `--panel`" cannot *be* `--panel`, even
when the two are the same value in one theme. An uncolored Calculator row
was `--panel`, which on paper still reads because the row carries a shadow
- but in dark it was the exact tone of the page behind it and vanished.
Hence `--finance-row-bg`: same near-white as before in light, a lifted grey
in dark. Look for the same trap anywhere a card defaults to the surface it
sits on.

The theme is stamped on `<html>` by a blocking inline script in the
`<head>`, above the stylesheet link, so no frame of the wrong theme ever
paints. It reads localStorage, falls back to `prefers-color-scheme`, and
follows the OS only until the toggle is used once. Never apply the theme by
`@media` alone: the toggle has to be able to beat the OS in both
directions.

Two traps this cost: **`element.className` is read-only on an SVG** (it is
an `SVGAnimatedString`), so the icon-swap classes silently did nothing and
both icons stayed lit - use `setAttribute("class", ...)`. And when auditing
contrast, composite the alpha: a `rgba(...,0.22)` pill measured as if it
were opaque reports a 1.27:1 failure that does not exist.

**The rail is its own column, sized to the window.** `position: sticky;
top: 0; height: 100vh` - not to the page beside it. Nothing sat at the
rail's bottom edge until the theme toggle did, so the rail quietly growing
to match a long page never showed; now it would drift the toggle by however
far that page overflows and scroll it off on a long one.

**One rail, no header.** The app used to carry two pieces of navigation
furniture. Measured, the pair took 27% of a 1280x800 window and 30% of a
1120x720 one - and the smaller the window, the worse, because both bands
were a fixed size. The header held three things: a wordmark (in a
personal tool you launched yourself, in its own window, the least
informative row of pixels on screen), a 527px search box sized like a web
app's global search, and a theme toggle with no listener behind it. The
first two moved into the rail and the third was deleted rather than left
as a control that does nothing - it returned to the rail's foot, wired up,
when dark mode landed. Chrome is now 19% at 1280x800, 22% at
1120x720.

The band it returns is on the axis that is actually scarce: every page
that overflowed in the fit work overflowed vertically, never
horizontally. The fit helpers picked the 77px up on their own - Studio
Logs went from 11 rows to 13 at 1280x800, Notes from 12 to 15 - and it
took Overview from 106% of that window to 96%, which is the
overflow the fit work could not reach.

Two things to know if you touch the shell again: `.body-row` is what makes
the rail and the content field sit side by side, so deleting header CSS
around it silently stacks them vertically; and the search results panel is
deliberately wider (330px) than the 247px rail that holds it, breaking out
over the content field, because a rail-width dropdown cannot show a result
title.

**Long lists are capped to what fits the window, not to a number.** Every
tool whose data grows without bound shows a window onto it with a "Show N
more" button, and how big that window is comes from `applyRowFit` /
`rowsOfCardsThatFit` in nav.js: enough rows are rendered to overflow any
plausible window, the real row height is measured from the laid-out DOM,
and whatever does not reach the bottom edge is hidden. A constant is right
at exactly one window size and wrong everywhere else - too many rows on a
short window, half a page of nothing on a tall one. Measured across
1100x700 to 1920x1080 on a full database, the capped pages land 87-99% of
the viewport at every size, and Studio Logs goes from 9 rows to 18.

Four rules when adding one:

- Apply the cap **after** filtering, so narrowing by a column narrows what
  the cap counts.
- If a newly created row would land outside the cap, expand first - never
  create something the user cannot see (see the add handlers in
  gatherer.js and finance.js).
- Re-run on resize, debounced, with a timer **per registration** -
  `onRowFitResize` used to share one timer, which let each tool cancel the
  others so only the last registered ever re-fit.
- Re-render when the page becomes visible. A first render while the
  section is still `display: none` measures every height as zero, so the
  cap concludes that everything fits and hides nothing. `showPage` in
  nav.js calls back into tracker, gatherer, finance, notes and todo for
  exactly this reason; a new tool that measures its own layout needs the
  same hook.
- Measure from the **document**, not the viewport (`documentTopOf`).
  `getBoundingClientRect().top` goes negative once the page is scrolled,
  so "room left below" computes as far more than exists - expanding a
  list and scrolling down to the collapse button made the next fit decide
  everything fits, and collapse silently did nothing.

Three shapes, three helpers, because the geometry genuinely differs:
`applyRowFit` for a stack of equal rows (tables), `rowsOfCardsThatFit` for
a wrapping card grid where the unit is a row of cards, and
`applyColumnFit` for Notes' CSS multi-column grid, which has no rows at
all - hiding one card reflows every card after it, so it estimates from
the height ratio then corrects a step at a time. A kanban board is the
exception that scrolls instead: `fitBoardHeight` caps `.todo-board`'s
height so it ends at the fold and scrolls internally, because capping it
would mean a "Show more" button per column.

**A dynamically created `input[type="date"]` must opt in.**
`enhanceDateField()` is swept over the document once on `DOMContentLoaded`,
which covers the static fields in index.html but never table rows built
later. Every render that emits a date input has to call
`enhanceDateField()` on it itself - see `wireGathererRowEvents` and
`renderTaskTable`. Miss it and the row silently keeps the OS-formatted
native control while every other date in the app shows the custom one.

**An empty panel offers the action.** `.empty-action` is the shared empty
state: a ghost button in To Do's `.kanban-col-new` language (faint text on
a barely-there tint, brightening on hover). An empty panel is the moment a
user is most likely to want the missing thing, so it hands them the way to
make it rather than only reporting the absence. Overview's four
panels and the project modal's Log all use it. Don't ship a bare grey
sentence as an empty state.

**Dates never render in the OS's format.** `enhanceDateField()` in nav.js
replaces every `input[type="date"]` with a trigger button plus a calendar
popover, and prints one fixed format (`18 Aug 2026`) everywhere. A native
date input picks its format from the operating system, so the same field
reads `mm/dd/yyyy` on one machine and `dd/mm/yyyy` on another - the only
control in the app whose appearance wasn't ours. The native input stays in
the DOM, hidden, as the source of truth: existing code keeps assigning
`.value` and listening for `change` exactly as before.

**Every popover type must declare its own open state.** `.popover-panel`
is `display: none` and the shared `.open` class sets no display of its
own - only `.color-preset-popover.open` did, so a new popover with
`class="popover-panel foo open"` renders, answers `querySelectorAll`, and
even accepts scripted `.click()` while being completely invisible. That
combination makes it easy to write a passing test for a popover nobody can
see; assert a non-zero `getBoundingClientRect()` and drive it with a real
mouse click, not `element.click()`.

**Escape inside a modal needs the capture phase.** A popover opened from
inside a modal shares `document` with the modal's own Escape handler, and
`stopPropagation()` does not stop a sibling listener on the same element.
Bind with `{ capture: true }` and use `stopImmediatePropagation()`, or one
Escape closes both layers at once (see `onDateFieldKeydown`).

**Modals animate; nothing else does.** `.modal-backdrop > .modal` gets a
200ms `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` entry from `scale(0.97)` and 6px
up. Page switching happens dozens of times a day and stays instant - a
transition on something that frequent is a tax paid all day. A modal is
occasional, and a hard cut reads as the page being replaced rather than
covered. Entry only: closing is the user's own action with their eye
already on the button. Never `scale(0)`; reduced motion keeps the fade and
drops the movement.

**A page takes a panel wrapper unless its contents already carry the panel
tone.** Projects, Studio Logs, Calculator and Notes wrap their
contents in `.panel` (`--panel-alt`, contents light inside). To Do does
not, and shouldn't: its `.kanban-col` already *is* that layer, so a
wrapper would make three levels (wrapper / column / card) out of a
two-tone system - the columns would vanish into the wrapper, or the cards
into the columns. Two tones, two levels; a third level needs a third
token, which isn't worth adding.

**The page gap is leftover space, not a percentage.** `.ct-card` sets its
side padding with `clamp(20px, calc((100vw - 1400px) / 2), 180px)`. The
gap exists to stop content sprawling on a full-screen display, so it may
only spend room the window can spare: nothing below ~1400px, growing from
there, capped at 180px. It was a flat `10%` before, which took the same
cut at every size - a windowed app lost the room its tables needed and
started scrolling sideways, content that fit fine before the gap existed
no longer did. This app is meant to be run windowed, so the narrow end is
the case that has to be right. A page that wants the full field can cancel
the gap with `margin-inline: calc(var(--ct-pad-x) * -1)` rather than by
overriding the padding.

**A kanban board is allowed to scroll sideways.** `.kanban-col` is
`flex: 0 0 230px` on purpose - past a certain number of lists no window
fits them all, and shrinking the columns to avoid a scrollbar squishes
the cards instead. That one horizontal scroll is the board's own sizing,
not the page gap.

A few shared rules to keep in mind so new UI stays consistent with the
rest of the app instead of drifting:

- **Rounded corners everywhere.** Every container, button, input, pill,
  and popover uses one of the `--radius-*` tokens in
  `frontend/static/css/app.css` (`--radius-lg` for panels/cards,
  `--radius-md` for buttons/dropdowns, `--radius-sm` for small icon
  buttons, `--radius-pill` for status pills, `50%` for circular
  swatches) - never a bare `border-radius` value and never left
  unset. A couple of elements (Notes cards, Calculator's tab buttons,
  popovers, the modal close button) previously shipped without one and
  read as sharp against everything else; that's the failure mode to
  avoid when adding something new. The one exception is the shell
  itself - the search bar and sidebar's active-row card still use the
  flat `--radius-shell` (9px) per the Figma spec instead of the lg/md/sm
  scale, but the content field (`.ct-card`) is deliberately square with
  no radius at all, per the later wireframe that dropped its rounded
  top-left corner.
- **Light theme, one typeface.** `--bg`/`--panel`/`--panel-alt`/`--text`/
  etc. in `:root` now hold the light palette (dark mode is parked, not
  deleted - it'll come back as a toggle). Every page uses the same
  Google Sans Flex family (`frontend/static/fonts/`, Light 300, Regular
  400, Medium 500, Bold 700). Light started out on the sidebar and the
  search fields, per the Figma spec, and has since been walked back off
  every one of them: the sidebar tabs are Medium (they are the app's
  top-level destinations, and 12px Regular read as faint beside
  everything around them), and the three search inputs are Regular. The
  `@font-face` for 300 is still declared and the file still ships, but
  nothing asks for it - a rule that wants Light will work, there just
  isn't one. Don't reintroduce a second typeface for a single element
  (the "VAIO" brand wordmark briefly used a serif before this
  shipped) - one face,
  used consistently, is the whole point. Only request weights that have
  a real `@font-face` file backing them (300/400/500/700) - asking for
  an unbacked weight like 600 makes the browser synthesize a faux-bold
  face, which renders heavier than intended and can glitch into
  mixed-weight/mixed-color glyphs on some letters. Page titles
  (`.page-title`) are 22px/400, matching `.cc-greeting` exactly.
- **Panel is the dark tone, contents are the light tone.** The container
  that wraps a page's board/table/grid (`.panel` in Projects,
  Studio Logs, and Calculator; `.kanban-col` in To Do) uses `--panel-alt`
  (`#e6e5e1`) with no border, and everything inside it that reads as a
  discrete card, field, or button - cards, `.cell-input`, dropdowns/
  pills on hover or focus, non-text buttons - uses `--panel` (`#fafafa`)
  instead, standing out against the darker wrapper rather than blending
  into a light one behind an outline. Projects's Personal
  Projects section is a direct-child `.panel` of the same page, so it
  picks this up automatically rather than needing its own rule. This is
  the default for any new page or panel going forward - match it rather
  than falling back to the older light-panel-with-border look.
- **Qualify selectors that override a generic input rule.** The catch-all
  `input[type="text"], input[type="password"], ...` rule in app.css has
  higher specificity than a bare class selector, so a class-only
  override (e.g. `.overview-search-input`) can silently lose to it. Use
  an element+class selector (`input.overview-search-input`) to tie
  specificity and win on source order instead.
- **One color-picker trigger app-wide.** Every color control in the app
  (Calculator's row color, To Do's list color, Notes' card color)
  renders the same `.color-dot-btn` / `.color-dot` pair from app.css:
  a `<button class="color-dot-btn">` wrapping a
  `<span class="color-dot">`, with `--dot-color` set on the button or
  any ancestor. The pattern started as Calculator's row dot and was
  promoted to the standard from there, replacing the older fixed-16px
  `.swatch-btn`. Two things make it work and both need to stay in sync
  if the sizes change: the button is much bigger than the dot (22px vs
  8px) and is pulled back by a negative margin of exactly half that
  difference (7px), so its *layout* footprint is still the dot's 8px and
  it never shifts what sits beside it - the extra size is pure hit area
  reaching into surrounding whitespace; and entering that area grows the
  dot to 14px to meet the cursor, so you never have to land a click on
  an 8px target. Resize that one rule rather than overriding per-tool,
  and don't reintroduce a per-tool swatch. `--dot-color` falls back to a
  neutral when unset, so an uncolored item needs no separate "empty"
  variant (To Do used to swap in a half-fill glyph for that; it doesn't
  any more). The one per-tool decision left is *what* color to feed it:
  Calculator and To Do pass the item's own color, while Notes passes a
  fixed neutral instead, since there the color already fills the whole
  card behind the dot and a matching dot would vanish into it.
- **One icon size app-wide.** The sidebar nav (`.sb-item svg`) is the
  standard every icon button in the app now matches: Lucide markup at
  `viewBox="0 0 24 24"` with `stroke-width="2"`, rendered at 16x16px -
  not smaller. Calculator's per-row toggle (circle-power) and delete
  (trash-2) icons were originally sized down to fit their buttons and
  read as illegibly small; both the icons and the buttons around them
  were resized up to match the sidebar instead of shrinking the icon to
  fit a smaller button. Setting `width`/`height: 16px` on an svg isn't
  enough by itself inside a *fixed-size* flex `<button>` - Chromium
  silently shrinks it further (16px measured as 12px in practice) even
  though there's room, a quirk the sidebar's own full-width button
  never triggers. `flex-shrink: 0` on the svg is what actually holds it
  at the specified size; any new icon-in-a-small-button control needs
  the same rule or it'll quietly render undersized again.
- **A mirror-span sizer must be `display: block`.** The auto-width
  fields (Calculator's table title and row Title) size themselves by
  mirroring their text into a hidden sibling `<span>` and pinning the
  real `<input>` over it with `inset: 0`. A `<span>` is inline, and
  vertical padding on an inline box *paints but adds no layout height*
  - horizontal padding does, so a sizer left inline gets the width
  right and the height silently wrong. The measure box then collapses
  to one line-height, the absolutely-positioned input is locked to
  that height while still carrying its own vertical padding, and its
  text is pushed down and clipped at the bottom. The tell is that
  raising the padding makes the clipping *worse* rather than better,
  because the box being padded inside of never grows. Measure
  `getBoundingClientRect().height` on the measure element when a field
  looks vertically cramped - if it equals the line-height, this is why.
- **Qualify an input's own `:focus`/`:read-only`, not just its base
  rule.** `input[type="text"]:focus` in app.css's catch-all sets its
  own `border-color`, at a specificity a plain `.my-input:focus` class
  selector loses to (see "Qualify selectors that override a generic
  input rule" above for the same fight at rest). A scoped input needs
  `input.my-input:focus` to win by source order, *and* to re-declare
  `border-color` itself if it wants a different one - inheriting only
  `outline: none` from your own rule still leaves the generic
  `border-color` painting a border you never asked for. Calculator's
  table-title and row-title fields both hit this exact gap.
- **One color picker, everywhere.** `openColorPresetPopover()` in
  `frontend/static/js/nav.js` is the app's only color picker - two
  single-hue tonal ramps (green, blue - `COLOR_PRESET_RAMPS` in the same
  file), five swatches each, plus a "No color" link. A free-form hue/
  saturation wheel with a lightness slider and hex field came before
  this and got replaced: precise, but slower than a one-click pick for
  something meant to be quick. Every color-picking swatch in the app (To
  Do's list color, Notes' card color, Calculator's row color, and
  whatever gets added next) opens this one popover and hands it a save
  callback and a clear callback, rather than keeping its own popover or
  preset list. `colorNeedsDarkText()` (also in nav.js, a standard luma
  check) decides whether a chosen color is light enough to need dark
  text instead of light text on top of it - it only matters for a
  picker that tints an entire surface with text on it (currently just
  Notes' card background); a picker that only fills a small standalone
  swatch icon (To Do, Calculator) never needs this since there's no
  text sitting on the color itself. Notes applies `note-card-light` or
  `note-card-dark` depending on which way that check goes - two classes,
  not one, since the app's own default text color is dark now (light
  theme) and needs to flip the opposite way for a note whose own chosen
  color happens to be dark.

**A hairline on the inverted panel has to be an ink wash, not
`--border-soft`.** The app's board/table panels use the darker
`--panel-alt` tone, and in both themes `--border-soft` sits within a
point or two of it (`#e5e3dd` on `#e6e5e1`; `#272727` on `#262626`). A
1px rule in that color renders and is simply invisible - Documents' row
separators looked like they had never been written. `--ink-08`, the
text ink at 8%, is the right token for a separator *inside* an inverted
panel; `--border-soft` is for a border between a panel and the page.

**A column of values only lines up if its grid track is a fixed width.**
Each Documents row is its own grid, so an `auto` track sizes to that
row's own content - the moment one row grew a tag chip, its date moved
and the column wobbled down the page. A fixed track (`96px`) plus
`text-align: right` gives one straight edge regardless of what the rows
either side contain. `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` is the other
half: without it a `1` and a `9` are different widths and the same
column wobbles by a fraction.

**Flexbox aligns margin boxes, so a heading's own margin misaligns the
row it is centered in.** `.page-title` carries `margin-bottom: 20px`;
putting it in a `display: flex; align-items: center` row beside a button
centers *that margin box*, which drops the title 10px above the button
it is supposed to sit level with. The fix is to zero the title's margin
inside the row and move it to the row itself.

**Deriving a group from "the folder above the folder" breaks on the
first tree with an extra level.** `/Clients/Atlas/Invoices/x.pdf` gives
"Atlas" and looks correct; `/Clients/Cedar/2024/Invoices/x.pdf` gives
"2024", and every client with a year folder collapses into the same
handful of meaningless groups. `docscan._group_of` walks *up* from the
file instead, skipping names that carry no identity - the search terms
themselves (an "Invoices" folder only says what is inside it, which is
why the file matched) and bare years - and takes the first name left.

**Anything keyed by path loses its data the first time a file moves.**
Documents' tags are stored against a content hash for exactly this
reason: the user reorganises their folders in Finder, not in VAIO, and
a tag that vanishes when an invoice is filed into a different client
folder is worse than no tag at all. The rule generalises - when the
system of record is outside the app, key your own data to something
the outside world does not renumber.

**"Nothing found" and "could not look" must never render the same.** A
rescan over an unreadable or missing folder returns a reason and leaves
the existing index alone, rather than clearing it and showing an empty
list - clearing a working list because a permissions prompt had not
been answered yet is a data-loss bug wearing an empty state's clothes.
The status line is left alone by the empty-state branch for the same
reason: an empty index is precisely when "that folder no longer exists"
is the thing you still need to see.
